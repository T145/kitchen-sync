Pulls all [stevejenkins](https://github.com/stevejenkins) Pihole repo content into simple lists.

## Description

The [`pihole-cloudsync`](https://github.com/stevejenkins/pihole-cloudsync#readme) project asks users to fork a repo template labeled "[my-pihole-lists](https://github.com/stevejenkins/my-pihole-lists)" to use its services, which a suprising number of people have done. This project simply seeks to consolidate the efforts from each user.
